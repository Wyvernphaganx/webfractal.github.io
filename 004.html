    <h1>Koch snowflake</h1>
    <div id="textboxS">
      The Koch snowflake is made using the Koch curve. The Koch curve was by described by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch. It begins with a straight line. Which is then divided into three equal segments and replace the middle segment by the two sides of an equilateral triangle with the same length as the removed segment. 
      Repeat this process on all the segments repeatedly and the Koch curve is made.
